        Why are sea turtles endangered?
    </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="threats">
        <p>
            Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.

        Oil spill and marine pollution
    </h2>
    <div class="container">

 </div>
 <div class="para1">
   <p>An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. 
 
   </p>
<p>
    Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when they try to eat them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—called ghost gear—entangles sea turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and prevent them from reaching the ocean. Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.
</p>
<p>
    Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and disrupt nesting behavior and hatchling orientation.

    <h3>
    Ways to reduce marine pollution
</h3>
<div class="container">
<div class="ways">
    <img src="ways.jpg">
</div>
<div class="intro">
<p>Avoid chemical fertilizers. The chemical fertilizer that you use on your lawn or in your garden can eventually make its way to the ocean through rivers, rainwater, and other waterways—even if you live far from the coast. To reduce the chance of leaching chemical fertilizer and polluting the ocean, opt for natural fertilizer options like compost, bone meal, and aged manure.
</p>
<p>
    Recycling is a process that converts used materials into new ones, keeping waste out of trash cans, gutters, and landfills, where they could be taken by wind or water to the ocean. Reach out to your local recycling plant or waste management operation for an approved list of recyclables.

<h2>
    Fisheries by-catch
</h2>
<div class="container">
<div class="img2">
    <img src="fisheries.jpg" >
 </div>
 <div class="para2">
    It’s estimated that the fishing industry contributes to the death of thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles each year. Turtles that become trapped in longlines, gill nets and trawls are thrown away as bycatch. And those that manage to avoid fishing nets are impacted by the disruption to their food supply and habitat.
 </div>
</div>
 
 <h2>
    Coastal Development
 </h2>
 <div class="container">
 <div class="img3">
<img src="coastal.jpg">
 </div>
 <div class="para3">
Every year, sea turtle habitats are destroyed because of shrinking coastlines. Wherever there is boat vessel traffic, whenever a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and wherever there is sea floor dredging and beach erosion sea turtle food supplies and nesting areas take a major hit.
 </div>
</div>

 <h2>
    Climate Change
 </h2>
 <div class="container">
<div class="img4">
    <img src="climate 2.jpg">
</div>
<div class="para4">
    We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.

    All stages of a sea turtle's life are affected by environmental conditions such as temperature—even the sex of offspring. Unusually warm temperatures caused by climate change are disrupting the normal ratios, resulting in fewer male hatchlings.

    Warmer sea surface temperatures can also lead to the loss of important foraging grounds for sea turtles, while increasingly severe storms and sea level rise can destroy critical nesting beaches and damage nests.</div>
